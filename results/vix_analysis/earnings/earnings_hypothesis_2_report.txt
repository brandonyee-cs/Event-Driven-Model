===== Hypothesis 2 Test Report =====

Hypothesis 2: VIX changes proxy impact and secondary uncertainties
             Pre-event VIX increases predict stronger returns
             Post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns during post-event rising phase
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

Part 1: Pre-event VIX increases predict stronger returns
Supported: True
Pearson correlation: r = 0.0227 (p = 0.0000)
Spearman correlation: œÅ = 0.0280 (p = 0.0000)
Number of observations: 33684

Part 2: Post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns
Supported: True
Average Pearson correlation: 0.0086
Average Spearman correlation: 0.0275
Days with significant positive Pearson correlation: 6/10
Days with significant positive Spearman correlation: 7/10

Overall Hypothesis 2 Supported: True

Conclusion: The results support Hypothesis 2. VIX changes do appear to proxy impact and
secondary uncertainties, with pre-event VIX increases predicting stronger returns and
post-event VIX spikes correlating with elevated returns during the post-event rising phase.
