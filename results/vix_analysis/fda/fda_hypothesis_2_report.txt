===== Hypothesis 2 Test Report =====

Hypothesis 2: VIX changes proxy impact and secondary uncertainties
             Pre-event VIX increases predict stronger returns
             Post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns during post-event rising phase
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

Part 1: Pre-event VIX increases predict stronger returns
Supported: False
Pearson correlation: r = 0.0423 (p = 0.7043)
Spearman correlation: œÅ = -0.0191 (p = 0.8636)
Number of observations: 83

Part 2: Post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns
Supported: True
Average Pearson correlation: 0.0162
Average Spearman correlation: 0.0295
Days with significant positive Pearson correlation: 0/10
Days with significant positive Spearman correlation: 1/10

Overall Hypothesis 2 Supported: False

Conclusion: The results do not fully support Hypothesis 2. Pre-event VIX increases do not predict stronger returns, and post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns during the post-event rising phase.
