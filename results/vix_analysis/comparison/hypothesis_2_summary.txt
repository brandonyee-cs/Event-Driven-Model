===== Hypothesis 2 Test Summary =====

Hypothesis 2: VIX changes proxy impact and secondary uncertainties
             Pre-event VIX increases predict stronger returns
             Post-event VIX spikes correlate with elevated returns during post-event rising phase
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

--- FDA Approval Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: False
Part 1 (Pre-event) Supported: False
Part 2 (Post-event) Supported: True
Pre-event Pearson correlation: r = 0.042273606495823
Pre-event Pearson p-value: p = 0.7043464325366977
Post-event avg Pearson correlation: r = 0.016190025931572875
Post-event significant days: 0/10

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: True
Part 1 (Pre-event) Supported: True
Part 2 (Post-event) Supported: True
Pre-event Pearson correlation: r = 0.022690355414193973
Pre-event Pearson p-value: p = 3.116417091878885e-05
Post-event avg Pearson correlation: r = 0.008579210950556254
Post-event significant days: 6/10

=== Conclusion ===
Hypothesis 2 is supported by Earnings Announcement events but not by FDA Approval events.
