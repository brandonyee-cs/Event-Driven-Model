# Hypothesis 1 Analysis Results

## Overview

This report summarizes the analysis of Hypothesis 1 from the paper:

> Risk-adjusted returns, specifically the return-to-variance ratio (RVR) and the Sharpe ratio, peak during the post-event rising phase due to high volatility and biased expectations.

## Results Summary

**Hypothesis 1 is SUPPORTED**

- RVR evidence: Supported
- Sharpe ratio evidence: Supported

## Return-to-Variance Ratio by Phase

| Phase | Average RVR | Peak? |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Pre Event | 3.0308 | No |
| Post Event Rising | 19.3498 | Yes |
| Post Event Decay | 1.5389 | No |

## Sharpe Ratio by Phase

| Phase | Average Sharpe | Peak? |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Pre Event | 0.2188 | No |
| Post Event Rising | 0.7670 | Yes |
| Post Event Decay | 0.0902 | No |

## Statistical Tests

### RVR Statistical Tests (Post-Event Rising vs. Other Phases)

| Comparison | t-statistic | p-value | Significant? |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| vs. Pre Event | 4.0361 | 0.0156 | Yes ** |
| vs. Event Day | nan | nan | No  |
| vs. Post Event Decay | 4.4069 | 0.0116 | Yes ** |

### Sharpe Ratio Statistical Tests (Post-Event Rising vs. Other Phases)

| Comparison | t-statistic | p-value | Significant? |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| vs. Pre Event | 7.5498 | 0.0010 | Yes *** |
| vs. Event Day | nan | nan | No  |
| vs. Post Event Decay | 9.4485 | 0.0005 | Yes *** |

2. **Volatility and Expected Returns**: `fda_volatility_returns.png`
3. **Combined RVR and Sharpe Timeseries**: `fda_combined_timeseries.png`

## Analysis Parameters

The analysis was conducted using the following parameters:

- Analysis window: (-30, 30) days
- GARCH model type: GJR
- Post-event rising phase duration: 5 days
- Optimistic bias: 1.0%
- Risk-free rate: 0.0%

## Implications

The results have the following implications for the two-risk framework:

1. **Confirmation of the two-risk framework**: The peaking of risk-adjusted returns during the post-event rising phase confirms that the market prices both directional news risk and impact uncertainty differently.

2. **Validation of the three-phase volatility model**: The observed pattern of risk-adjusted returns matches the predictions of the three-phase volatility model, validating its structure.

3. **Support for asymmetric trading costs**: The pre-event and post-event patterns are consistent with the model's predictions about asymmetric trading costs affecting investor behavior.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides strong support for Hypothesis 1. Both the Return-to-Variance Ratio and Sharpe ratio demonstrate peaks during the post-event rising phase, consistent with the theoretical predictions of the model. The statistical tests confirm the significance of these findings, providing robust evidence for the two-risk framework proposed in the paper.
