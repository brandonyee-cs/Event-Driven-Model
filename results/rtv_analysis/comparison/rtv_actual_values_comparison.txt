===== Hypothesis 1 Test Results (Actual Values) =====

Parameter Î´ (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

--- FDA Approval Events ---
Pre-Event Phase: Mean RTV = 3.1908
Post-Event Rising Phase: Mean RTV = 3.1169
Post-Event Decay Phase: Mean RTV = 2.1567
Hypothesis Supported: False

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---
Pre-Event Phase: Mean RTV = 1.6376
Post-Event Rising Phase: Mean RTV = 1.2206
Post-Event Decay Phase: Mean RTV = 2.3487
Hypothesis Supported: False

=== Conclusion ===
Hypothesis 1 is not supported by either FDA Approval or Earnings Announcement events.
This suggests that the hypothesized return-to-variance pattern may not be consistent.
