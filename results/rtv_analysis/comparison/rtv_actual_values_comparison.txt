===== Hypothesis 1 Test Results (Actual Values) =====

Parameter Î´ (post-event rising phase duration): 5 days

--- FDA Approval Events ---
Pre-Event Phase: Mean RTV = 3.2342
Post-Event Decay Phase: Mean RTV = 2.1324
Hypothesis Supported: False

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---
Pre-Event Phase: Mean RTV = 1.6697
Post-Event Rising Phase: Mean RTV = 21.3437
Post-Event Decay Phase: Mean RTV = 1.9649
Hypothesis Supported: True

=== Conclusion ===
Hypothesis 1 is supported by Earnings Announcement events but not by FDA Approval events.
This suggests differences in market behavior between financial and regulatory events.

--- Time Series Analysis ---
In addition to phase-based analysis, a time series analysis of RTV ratio was conducted
to provide a more granular view of changes around events. Time series plots are available in
the respective 'timeseries' subdirectories for FDA (results/rtv_analysis/fda/timeseries) and
Earnings (results/rtv_analysis/earnings/timeseries) events.
