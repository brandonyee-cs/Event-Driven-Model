===== Refined Hypothesis 2 Test Report =====

Refined Hypothesis 2: VIX dynamics around events reflect differentiated uncertainty profiles:
  1. Pre-event VIX changes reflect market sentiment rather than directly predicting return magnitudes
  2. Post-event VIX movements correlate with contemporaneous returns confirming impact uncertainty's resolution
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

Part 1: Pre-event VIX as market sentiment indicator
Supported: True
VIX change vs. concurrent returns Pearson: r = -0.2167 (p = 0.0491)
VIX change vs. concurrent returns Spearman: ρ = -0.0514 (p = 0.6446)
Number of observations: 83
VIX volatility vs. concurrent returns Pearson: r = 0.0299 (p = 0.3718)
VIX volatility vs. concurrent returns Spearman: ρ = 0.0177 (p = 0.5956)
Number of observations: 897

Part 2: Post-event VIX correlations with returns
Supported: True
Average Pearson correlation: 0.0162
Average Spearman correlation: 0.0295
Days with significant positive Pearson correlation: 0/10
Days with significant positive Spearman correlation: 1/10

Overall Refined Hypothesis 2 Supported: True

Conclusion: The results support the refined Hypothesis 2. VIX dynamics around events do reflect
differentiated uncertainty profiles. Pre-event VIX changes serve as a market sentiment indicator,
correlating with concurrent returns rather than predicting future returns. Post-event VIX movements
correlate with contemporaneous returns, confirming the resolution of impact uncertainty.
