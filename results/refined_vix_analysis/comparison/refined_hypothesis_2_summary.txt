===== Refined Hypothesis 2 Test Summary =====

Refined Hypothesis 2: VIX dynamics around events reflect differentiated uncertainty profiles:
  1. Pre-event VIX changes reflect market sentiment rather than directly predicting return magnitudes
  2. Post-event VIX movements correlate with contemporaneous returns confirming impact uncertainty's resolution
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

--- FDA Approval Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: True
Part 1 (Sentiment Indicator) Supported: True
Part 2 (Post-event Correlation) Supported: True
VIX change vs. concurrent returns: r = -0.2167
VIX change vs. concurrent returns p-value: 0.0491
Post-event avg Pearson correlation: r = 0.0162
Post-event significant days: 0/10

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: False
Part 1 (Sentiment Indicator) Supported: False
Part 2 (Post-event Correlation) Supported: True
VIX change vs. concurrent returns: r = -0.0046
VIX change vs. concurrent returns p-value: 0.4004
Post-event avg Pearson correlation: r = 0.0086
Post-event significant days: 6/10

=== Conclusion ===
The refined Hypothesis 2 is supported by FDA Approval events but not by Earnings Announcement events.
This may suggest that uncertainty profiles differ between regulatory and financial reporting events.
