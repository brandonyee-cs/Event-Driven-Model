===== Refined Hypothesis 2 Test Report =====

Refined Hypothesis 2: VIX dynamics around events reflect differentiated uncertainty profiles:
  1. Pre-event VIX changes reflect market sentiment rather than directly predicting return magnitudes
  2. Post-event VIX movements correlate with contemporaneous returns confirming impact uncertainty's resolution
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

Part 1: Pre-event VIX as market sentiment indicator
Supported: False
VIX change vs. concurrent returns Pearson: r = -0.0046 (p = 0.4004)
VIX change vs. concurrent returns Spearman: ρ = -0.0129 (p = 0.0182)
Number of observations: 33734
VIX volatility vs. concurrent returns Pearson: r = -0.0468 (p = 0.0000)
VIX volatility vs. concurrent returns Spearman: ρ = -0.0053 (p = 0.0091)
Number of observations: 241939

Part 2: Post-event VIX correlations with returns
Supported: True
Average Pearson correlation: 0.0086
Average Spearman correlation: 0.0275
Days with significant positive Pearson correlation: 6/10
Days with significant positive Spearman correlation: 7/10

Overall Refined Hypothesis 2 Supported: False

Conclusion: The results do not fully support the refined Hypothesis 2. Pre-event VIX changes do not show a clear relationship with market sentiment, and post-event VIX movements do correlate with contemporaneous returns as expected.
