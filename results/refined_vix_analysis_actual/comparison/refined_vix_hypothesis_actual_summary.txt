===== Refined Hypothesis 2 Test Summary (Actual Values) =====

Refined Hypothesis 2: VIX dynamics around events reflect differentiated uncertainty profiles:
  1. Pre-event VIX changes reflect market sentiment rather than directly predicting return magnitudes
  2. Post-event VIX movements correlate with contemporaneous returns confirming impact uncertainty's resolution
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 10 days

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---

Expected `str` or `DataType`, got 'Expr'.

=== Conclusion ===
The refined Hypothesis 2 is not fully supported by either FDA Approval or Earnings Announcement events.
Neither aspect of the hypothesis is consistently supported across event types.
Further refinement of the hypothesis or analysis methods may be required.
