===== Refined Hypothesis 2 Test Summary (Actual Values) =====

Refined Hypothesis 2: VIX dynamics around events reflect differentiated uncertainty profiles:
  1. Pre-event VIX changes reflect market sentiment rather than directly predicting return magnitudes
  2. Post-event VIX movements correlate with contemporaneous returns confirming impact uncertainty's resolution
Delta (post-event rising phase duration): 5 days

--- FDA Approval Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: False
Part 1 (Sentiment Indicator): False
Part 2 (Post-event Correlation): False
Pre-event avg Pearson correlation: 0.0049
Pre-event avg Spearman correlation: -0.0068
Pre-event days with significant Pearson correlation: 3/30
Post-event mean correlation: nan
Post-event median correlation: nan
Events with positive correlation: 851/892

--- Earnings Announcement Events ---
Overall Hypothesis Supported: False
Part 1 (Sentiment Indicator): False
Part 2 (Post-event Correlation): False
Pre-event avg Pearson correlation: 0.0104
Pre-event avg Spearman correlation: 0.0056
Pre-event days with significant Pearson correlation: 17/30
Post-event mean correlation: nan
Post-event median correlation: nan
Events with positive correlation: 228443/242518

=== Conclusion ===
The refined Hypothesis 2 is not fully supported by either FDA Approval or Earnings Announcement events.
Neither aspect of the hypothesis is consistently supported across event types.
Further refinement of the hypothesis or analysis methods may be required.
